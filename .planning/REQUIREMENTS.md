# Requirements

**Source:** Brainstorm output {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Phase traceability:** Step 2 (Brainstorm) → Step 5 (Spec)

## REQ-ID Format

`[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]` — e.g., `AUTH-01`, `CONT-02`, `UI-01`

Each requirement must be:
- **Specific & testable**: "User can reset password via email link" (not "add auth")
- **User-centric**: "User can X" (not "system does X")
- **Atomic**: One capability per requirement
- **Independent**: Minimal cross-dependencies

Every v1 requirement must map to exactly one phase in ROADMAP.md — 100% coverage required.

## v1 Requirements (Ship in initial release)

| REQ-ID | Requirement | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| {CAT}-01 | User can {specific, testable action} | Phase {N} |
| {CAT}-02 | User can {specific, testable action} | Phase {N} |

## v2 Requirements (Deferred — table stakes users expect)

| REQ-ID | Requirement | Reason deferred |
|---|---|---|
| {CAT}-03 | User can {action} | {why v2} |

## Out of Scope (Explicit exclusions)

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| {Feature} | {Reasoning} |

## Assumptions

- {Assumption 1}
